IMPLEMENTATION OF BALANCED HOMODYNE CIRCUIT

IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURE-

Assemble the necessary components and carefully setting up the optical and electronic elements.

A balanced homodyne circuit involves a laser source, beam splitter, photodetectors, mixer, local oscillator, and optional phase shifter, assembled on a breadboard with stable power supplies for testing and data acquisition.

Implementing a balanced homodyne circuit involves arranging components on a breadboard, connecting them, aligning and calibrating, testing, optimizing, and documenting the setup for precise signal measurements.
